GO:0009555	pollen development	"The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the pollen grain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The process begins with the meiosis of the microsporocyte to form four haploid microspores. The nucleus of each microspore then divides by mitosis to form a two-celled organism, the pollen grain, that contains a tube cell as well as a smaller generative cell. The pollen grain is surrounded by an elaborate cell wall. In some species, the generative cell immediately divides again to give a pair of sperm cells. In most flowering plants, however this division takes place later, in the tube that develops when a pollen grain germinates." [GOC:mtg_plant, GOC:mtg_sensu, GOC:tb]	biological_process

GO:0009641	shade avoidance	"Shade avoidance is a set of responses that plants display when they are subjected to the shade of another plant. It often includes elongation, altered flowering time, increased apical dominance and altered partitioning of resources. Plants are able to distinguish between the shade of an inanimate object (e.g. a rock) and the shade of another plant due to the altered balance between red and far-red light in the shade of a plant; this balance between red and far-red light is perceived by phytochrome."
