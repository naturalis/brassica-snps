## Materials and methods

> ### Supplementary info
> All data involved in the analyses we describe are available as supplementary materials from the following sources:
> - **Raw sequencing reads** - deposited at the short reads archive
> - **Genome alignments and raw variants** - data for each bulk are deposited separately to Zenodo
> - **Intermediate and result data** - deposited in one package to Zenodo
>
> To verify the analyses we performed, we have bundled all scripts, library code, and 3rd party software in a Docker
> image, which is available from the Docker hub as `naturalis/brassica-snps`
