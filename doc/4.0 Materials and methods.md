## Materials and methods

> The bioinformatic analyses described in the following sections can be re-run assuming that several prerequisites
> are met. These are:
> - software, perl packages and R libraries are installed
> - input and intermediate data are in place
> - the git repository is cloned locally and set up correctly
>
> ### Software prerequisites
> The following command installs most of the software packages:
>
>     sudo apt install \
>         cpanminus \
>         bwa \
>         samtools \
>         muscle \
>         sqlite \
>         r-base \
>         perl-doc \
>         graphviz \
>         libgd-perl
>
> The following command installs the perl packages:
>
>     sudo cpanm -n \
>         Log::Log4perl \
>         DBIx::Class \
>         DBD::SQLite \
>         Bio::Phylo \
>         Bio::DB::NCBIHelper \
>         Bio::SeqIO \
>         Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlastPlus \
>         GO::TermFinder \
>         git://github.com/naturalis/biomart-perl
>
> The following command, issued inside R, installs the R packages:
>
>     sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages("QTLseqr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")'
>
> - Needs to be install manually: GATK
> - The `/lib` folder in the repository must be added to the `PERL5LIB` search path
