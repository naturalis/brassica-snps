### Functional enrichment, refinement, and pathway analysis

We performed singular enrichment analyses [SEA; @Huang:2009] separately for all six contrasts using the agriGO web 
service [@Du:2010], which uses the Blast2GO [@Conesa:2008] results for _Brassica oleracea_ compiled by the Blast2GO 
Functional Annotation Repository [B2G-FAR; Gotz:2011] to establish a reference list against which to assess term 
enrichment by way of a hypergeometric test corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjaminiâ€“Yekutieli method 
[@Benjamini:2001]. To assess the overlap between our individual SEAs we merged their results in a cross comparison 
[SEACOMPARE; @Du:2010], which showed congruence in the enrichment of numerous terms related to reproduction across all 
contrasts. For each of the SEA result sets, we pruned the enriched (FDR<0.05) subgraph by retaining only those 
terms that are reproductive developmental processes, i.e. that are subtended by the upper-level term 
_developmental process involved in reproduction_ (GO:0003006) from the domain _biological process_ of the Gene 
Ontology [@Ashburner:2000]. Within the pruned subgraph, three out of the top-level terms are related to flower 
development or morphogenesis, one to seed maturation, and one (GO:0010228) was defined as:

_"The process involved in transforming a meristem that produces vegetative structures, such as leaves, into a meristem 
that produces reproductive structures, such as a flower or an inflorescence."_

As this developmental process precedes those identified by the other top-level terms in the subgraph, we took the 
list of genes annotated to these terms and used this as the input for a pathway enrichment analysis as implemented
in g:Profiler [@Reimand:2016].

> #### Supplementary info
> *Enrichment analyses* - The individual analyses were run on the agriGO web service 1.0, which has since gone out of
> service. However, the v2.0 implements the same core methods, just for more species and with some more additional 
> data exploration. We saved the following output for each contrast:
> - `${DATA}/contrasts/${CONTRAST}/enriched.png` - Subgraph of enriched GO terms and ancestors
> - `${DATA}/contrasts/${CONTRAST}/enriched.tsv` - Tabel with GO terms, SEA statistics and UniProt IDs
>
> We then forwarded the results of the SEAs to the cross comparison provided by SEACOMPARE. The
> [result](../results/seacompare.html) of this analysis identifies the contrasts only by their internal job ID, which
> corresponds with the contrasts like so:
> - EF-IF: 383155352 
> - EF-LF: 283547849
> - EF-NF: 847435652
> - IF-LF: 322714491
> - IF-NF: 933274933
> - LF-NF: 577207982

>> To assess whether terms returned by AgriGO are children of GO:0003006, we traversed the GO using the data release
> of 2018-09-13 (downloaded from http://snapshot.geneontology.org/ontology/go-basic.obo in OBO format version 1.2).
> We did this using [go_filter.pl](../script/go_filter.pl), which uses GO::TermFinder [@Boyle:2004]. This resulted
> in the following file for each contrast:
> - `${DATA}/contrasts/${CONTRAST}/enriched_GO_0003006.tsv` - Pruned version of enriched.tsv
