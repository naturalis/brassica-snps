# Are the Jersey Kale sequences functional?

Indels can result in frame shifts, which can introduce a 
stop codon in the translation. This would (likely) turn
the gene into a non-functional pseudogene, affecting
flowering time in that way. However, the only candidate where we 
see a stop codon inserted midway in the sequence is in
a single bulk for [Bo4g021200](Bo4g021200/group-5-NF.fasta).

# Are the Jersey Kale sequences uniformly different from the reference?

If the consensus sequences across the bulks all share SNPs
to the exclusion of the reference, this would suggest that 
there is a functional difference that is more or less fixed
in the JK in comparison with TO1000.

# Do the genes play a role in wood formation?

The idea here is that delayed flowering and woodiness may
be connected, and a very nice finding would be a candidate
gene with pleiotropic effect, modulating both phenotypes.
Check the Gene Ontology for this.

# Are the genes present in various pathways?

The idea here is that we would like to know what role the
genes play in pathways leading to flowering. A specific
resource that we might query for this is
[FLOR-ID](http://www.phytosystems.ulg.ac.be/florid/), a
more general one is
[KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)

# Are the genes present in the specific pathways for Brassica?

Here we need to consult the figures from the paper suggested
by Schranz, to see which parts of the general pathway we
are hitting.
