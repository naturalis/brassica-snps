The folders below this one contain the consensus sequences for the CDSs of interest as identified in 
[intersection.tsv](intersection.tsv). Since the bulks consist of F1 offspring from a cross between the (putatively) 
homozygous parent TO1000 and Jersey Kale, any variants with respect to the reference (i.e. TO1000) can have an allele 
frequency of at most 50% if the Kale is homozygous for the alternative, or 25% if it's heterozygous.

The data have been processed with the following steps:

1. [create codon alignments](README_alignments.md)
2. [gProfiler analysis](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gplink/l/5AaY0UNkTs)
