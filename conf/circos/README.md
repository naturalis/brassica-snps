Circos configuration
====================

This folder contains the main configuration file [circos.conf](circos.conf) and the dependencies
it references in order to generate Figure 2 of the manuscript using the Circos tool. For more 
about the structure of these config files and folders, refer to the documentation at
[Circos.ca](http://circos.ca).

Below this folder are mostly subfolders and files that are generic for running Circos, such as 
fonts and symbols. However, there are also some data tracks specific to the _B. oleracea_ study
and that were generated (or hand-coded) to create Figure 2. These are the following files:

- [data/karyotype/karyotype.brassica.txt](data/karyotype/karyotype.brassica.txt) - a hand-coded
  karyotype file that contains the start and stop coordinates of chromosomes and centromeres in
  the TO1000DH3 reference genome
- [data/genes/genes.txt](data/genes/genes.txt) - a hand-coded file containing the start and stop
  coordinates of genes relevant to flowering time in _B. oleracea_ according to past studies
- [data/g_prime/](data/g_prime/) - six continuous-valued data tracks containing the values for
  G' in windows of 10^6 bp as generated by 
  [../../script/circos_make_gprime.pl](../../script/circos_make_gprime.pl)
